# Developer Roadmap for WordShare

## Features to develop (priority in descending order)

### Finish Quickstart

Implement teacher verification progress, then join class process
Maybe allow user to go back (or burn in hell)

### Impl comment replies

Make comments have reply, maybe using searchparams to connect server and client side

### Create admin dashboard

Let admins (me) handle all verification requests and also all users, etc.

### Make class page

Create join and invite pages

### Task system

After class, it would be good if they got functional

### Invite system

Invite system is vital i guess

### Implement words by class

Make people add words and show them

### Add fun minigames with words

Like idk daily 5 words, something

### Make the overview page

shadcn ui blocks would be good

### Add functionality for fun

At this point the project should be mostly finished and ready to use

## WEBSCRAPE AND DO SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATIONS
